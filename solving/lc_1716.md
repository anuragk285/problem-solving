            #then answer will be, simply sum of first n natural numbers
        
        # if m number of full weeks and r extra days,
        # sum of money in m full weeks = ((m-1)*m*7)//2 + (m*28)

        # explanation, 

        # step 1: (calculating sum of money in full weeks)
        #   if we remove $1 from each day in 2nd week, $2 in 3rd week, ..... $(m-1) in mth week
        #   then sum money in each week will be 28, there are m such weeks including first, total sum = m * 28
        #   the sum of removed money will be, sum of first m-1 natural numbers multiplied by 7, i.e.. (((m-1)*m)//2) * 7

        # step 2: (calculating sum of money in extra days)
        #   hercy will put $m in bank on mth monday, 
        #   so, hercy will put $m, $m+1, #m+2.....('r' times) in extra days
        #   the total money in extra days will be, sum of natural numbers from m to (m + no_of_extra_days)
        #   let r be number of extra days, sum of money in extra days = (r*m) + r(r+1)/2

        # total money = money in full_weeks + money in extra days.
        # i.e, ((m-1)*m*7)//2 + (m*28) + (r*m) + (r*(r+1))//2
        return ((m-1)*m*7)//2 + (m*28) + (r*m) + (r*(r+1))//2
